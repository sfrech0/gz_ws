### Steps to do
#
# - Define the area of the choreography
# - Define exit-spots, based on the area and the number of drones
# - Create a ros node than can subscribe to the actual position of the drones
# - Based on the actual position, define a function that:
#       - selects the exit-spot that is the closest to each drone
#       - Computes the path to this spot
#       - Does collision avoidance
# - As soon as the user wants to execute the exit-plan, the other file has to be stopped
# - New position will be published to the drones
